# Sudoku

### Motivation
I created this recursive backtracking sudoku solver, after tutoring a student on how to implement a brute force program to solve a sudoku puzzle in python.
I used the curses library to aesthetically print the sudoku grid to illustrate the recursive backtracking.

### Usage
This program requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html).
It can be ran in the terminal with the command: "python sudoku.py". When ran, the program will attempt to solve the sudoku grid in the sudoku.txt file.
